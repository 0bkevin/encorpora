Write in a concise, precise, and instructional tone suitable for a comprehensive language textbook. Each file is part of a larger book â€” not a standalone blog post or article. Do not include introductions, summaries, or conclusions unless explicitly part of the content.

- Do **not** explain what the lesson will cover or summarize what was learned.
- Avoid generic enthusiasm or commentary about the beauty of the Korean language.
- Do **not** restate the filename or lesson number in the content.

For `lesson` files:
- Prioritize **Hangul**, supported with **romanization** and **English translation** where necessary for clarity.
- Structure the content around **real usage examples**, with brief explanations.
- Emphasize patterns and repetition to build reading fluency.
- Use minimal English. Keep it functional, not conversational.

For `culture` files:
- A more relaxed narrative tone is acceptable.
- Write engaging, informative content in English, using Korean terms where relevant.
- Help the learner understand how language and culture intersect without drifting into filler.

Throughout:
- Use consistent formatting with markdown headings as specified in `STRUCTURE.md`.
- Be direct. Favor clarity over style. Avoid fluff and filler.
- This is a **textbook**, not an online article.
