*Basic Korean* is a comprehensive beginnerâ€™s textbook focused on full literacy in Hangul, foundational grammar, and essential vocabulary. Though the title is modest, the goal is ambitious: to create a complete, structured, and immersive guide to the Korean language.

Each unit includes:
- one `intro` file with a clear overview,
- multiple `lesson` files filled with Hangul, romanization, and minimal English support,
- and a `culture` file that provides deeper insight into Korean life and context.

The core content should be Hangul-first, with romanization early on and natural, example-rich exposure to grammar and usage. Cultural sections offer space for English-rich storytelling to inspire meaningful engagement.
