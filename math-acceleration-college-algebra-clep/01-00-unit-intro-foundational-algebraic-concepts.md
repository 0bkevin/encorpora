This unit introduces the essential ideas of algebra. Here, you will learn about variables, expressions, and basic operations that form the language of algebra. We will explore how to create and simplify expressions, solve simple equations, and understand the relationships between numbers and symbols.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental because algebra is the cornerstone of college mathematics and many real-world applications. Whether you are calculating financial budgets, modeling engineering problems, or analyzing sports statistics, mastering these ideas will provide you with the tools needed to solve complex problems.

By learning how to manipulate and interpret algebraic expressions, you will gain problem-solving skills that are applicable in various fields. This unit builds the foundation for more advanced topics and practical applications in college-level mathematics.
