## Simplifying Expressions and Combining Like Terms

This lesson explains how to simplify algebraic expressions by combining like terms. Simplifying expressions is a fundamental skill in algebra that makes solving equations and modeling real-world scenarios more straightforward. This process is essential in fields like finance, engineering, and data analysis.

### Understanding Like Terms

> Like terms are terms that contain the same variable(s) raised to the same power. Only the coefficients (the numbers in front) may differ.

For example, consider the expression $3x + 5x$. Both terms share the same variable $x$ raised to the first power. When combined, they yield $8x$, the simplified form.

Think of combining like terms as organizing similar items together, just as you would group similar tools in a toolbox. This neat arrangement makes the expression easier to work with.

### Step-by-Step Process for Simplification

1. **Identify Like Terms:**

   Look for terms with the same variable part. Remember, constants (numbers without variables) are also like terms with each other.

2. **Group Like Terms:**

   Write like terms together. For example, consider the expression:

   $$
   5a + 3b - 2a + 7 - 4b
   $$

   Group the terms as follows:

   $$
   (5a - 2a) + (3b - 4b) + 7
   $$

3. **Combine the Coefficients:**

   Add or subtract the coefficients of the like terms:

   $$
   5a - 2a = 3a
   $$

   $$
   3b - 4b = -b
   $$

   Thus, the expression simplifies to:

   $$
   3a - b + 7
   $$

This methodical approach ensures that expressions are reduced to their simplest form, facilitating further manipulation or solving.

### Example 1: Simplify a Basic Expression

Simplify the expression:

$$
3x + 2x - 4
$$

**Solution:**

1. **Identify Like Terms:**

   The terms $3x$ and $2x$ are like terms, while $-4$ is a constant.

2. **Combine the Like Terms:**

   $$
   3x + 2x = 5x
   $$

3. **Write the Simplified Form:**

   $$
   5x - 4
   $$

This example demonstrates that grouping similar terms helps simplify the expression quickly.

### Example 2: Expression with Multiple Variables and Parentheses

Simplify the expression:

$$
2(3x + 4) - 5x + (6 - x)
$$

**Step 1: Remove Parentheses**

Use the distributive property to expand the expression:

$$
2 \cdot 3x + 2 \cdot 4 - 5x + 6 - x
$$

This expands to:

$$
6x + 8 - 5x + 6 - x
$$

**Step 2: Identify and Group Like Terms**

Group the $x$ terms and the constants:

$$
(6x - 5x - x) + (8 + 6)
$$

**Step 3: Combine Like Terms**

For the $x$ terms:

$$
6x - 5x - x = 0x
$$

For the constants:

$$
8 + 6 = 14
$$

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

$$
0x + 14 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 14
$$

In this case, the $x$ terms cancel each other out, leaving a constant value.

### Real-World Application

In financial planning, budgeting, or expense tracking, simplified expressions can consolidate recurring costs or incomes. For instance, if $3x$ represents the cost for three months and $2x$ for two months of the same expense, combining them gives the total cost for five months. This simplification makes it easier to manage and analyze the budget.

By mastering the process of simplifying expressions and combining like terms, you build a strong foundation for solving equations and handling real-world algebraic challenges more effectively.
