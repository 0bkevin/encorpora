## Mixed Problem Solving Techniques

This lesson covers a variety of strategies for solving algebraic problems that do not follow one single template. In many real-world scenarios, problems may combine different types of equations and require multiple problem-solving techniques. Understanding how to identify the type of problem and applying a structured approach can simplify even the most complex tasks.

### Identifying the Problem Type

Before solving a problem, examine the information provided:

- Look for keywords that indicate the operations involved (e.g., distribution, combining like terms, factoring).
- Identify whether the problem is linear, quadratic, or involves more than one step such as setting up an equation from a word problem.
- Decide on a method: whether to distribute, factor, or use the quadratic formula.

This careful review helps in selecting the most efficient strategy and avoids unnecessary work.

### Example 1: Solving a Complex Linear Equation

In this example, we solve a linear equation that requires both distribution and combining like terms. The strategy is to simplify each side of the equation before isolating the variable.

Consider the equation:

$$
3(2x - 3) + 4 = 2(x + 7)
$$

**Step 1: Distribute on both sides**

Distributing means multiplying the term outside the parentheses by each term inside the parentheses.

$$
6x - 9 + 4 = 2x + 14
$$

**Step 2: Combine like terms on the left side**

Combine the constant terms $-9$ and $4$:

$$
6x - 5 = 2x + 14
$$

**Step 3: Isolate the variable by subtracting $2x$ from both sides**

Subtract $2x$ from each side to collect all $x$ terms on one side:

$$
4x - 5 = 14
$$

**Step 4: Add $5$ to both sides**

Adding $5$ eliminates the constant on the left side:

$$
4x = 19
$$

**Step 5: Divide both sides by $4$**

Dividing by $4$ isolates $x$:

$$
x = \frac{19}{4}
$$

This step-by-step process clarifies how to simplify and solve equations by handling one operation at a time. The systematic approach is valuable when dealing with more complex algebra problems.

> Key concept: Breaking a problem into manageable parts and verifying each step builds accuracy and confidence in solving mixed problems.

### Example 2: Real-World Quadratic Problem

![Quadratic function $w^2+3w-54$ showing roots corresponding to garden dimensions](images/plot_2_12-02-lesson-mixed-problem-solving-techniques.md.png)

Sometimes, real-world scenarios lead to quadratic equations. In this example, we determine the dimensions of a rectangular garden using its area.

A rectangular garden has the following characteristics:

- Width: $w$ meters.
- Length: $w + 3$ meters (since the length is $3$ meters longer than the width).
- Area: $54$ square meters.

The area of a rectangle is given by:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{length}
$$

**Step 1: Set up the equation**

Express the area in terms of $w$:

$$
w(w + 3) = 54
$$

**Step 2: Expand the Equation**

Multiply $w$ by each term inside the parentheses:

$$
w^2 + 3w = 54
$$

**Step 3: Rearrange the equation to set it to zero**

Subtract $54$ from both sides to create a standard quadratic equation:

$$
w^2 + 3w - 54 = 0
$$

**Step 4: Factor the Quadratic Equation**

Find two numbers that multiply to $-54$ and add to $3$. The numbers $9$ and $-6$ satisfy these conditions. Write the quadratic as:

$$
w^2 + 9w - 6w - 54 = 0
$$

Group the terms:

$$
(w^2 + 9w) - (6w + 54) = 0
$$

Factor out the common terms:

$$
w(w + 9) - 6(w + 9) = 0
$$

Factor by grouping:

$$
(w + 9)(w - 6) = 0
$$

**Step 5: Solve for $w$**

Set each factor equal to zero:

$$
w + 9 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad w - 6 = 0
$$

Thus, $w = -9$ or $w = 6$. Since a negative width is not physically meaningful, we take $w = 6$ meters. The length is then:

$$
6 + 3 = 9 \quad \text{meters}
$$

**Step 6: Verify the Solution**

Check by calculating the area:

$$
6 \times 9 = 54 \quad \text{square meters}
$$

This confirms the garden dimensions. Factoring is an efficient method to solve quadratic equations by breaking them into simpler linear factors.

### Strategies for Mixed Problem Solving

- Always begin by identifying what is given and what needs to be found.
- Follow a systematic, step-by-step approach: distribute, combine like terms, isolate the variable, then verify your answer.
- Check your intermediate steps to prevent errors.
- For quadratic problems, try factoring first as it is usually the quickest method. If factoring is challenging, use the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Using these strategies, you can efficiently solve a wide range of algebraic problems. This flexible approach is essential for tackling varied challenges in college algebra and builds the foundation for tackling more complex scenarios.
