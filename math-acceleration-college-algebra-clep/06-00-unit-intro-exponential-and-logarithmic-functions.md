This unit introduces exponential and logarithmic functions, two fundamental types of functions that play a crucial role in mathematics and its applications.

In this unit, you will learn about:

- Exponential functions that model growth and decay processes, such as population growth, radioactive decay, and compound interest.
- Logarithmic functions, the inverses of exponential functions, which are used to solve equations and analyze phenomena like sound intensity and earthquake magnitudes.

Understanding these functions is important because they provide the tools to describe and predict real-world behavior in finance, science, engineering, and everyday problem-solving.

Throughout this unit, you will explore their properties, learn to graph them, and apply various techniques to solve related equations. The concepts you develop here will serve as a foundation for more advanced topics in algebra and calculus.

> Exponential functions burst forth like wild crescendos in natureâ€™s symphony, while logarithms serve as the gentle interpreters that reveal the measured rhythm behind the chaos.
