## Solving Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic Formula

A quadratic equation takes the form

$$
a x^2 + b x + c = 0,
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and $a \neq 0$. The quadratic formula

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

is a universal method to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation, even when the equation does not factor easily.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Write the Equation in Standard Form:**

   Ensure the quadratic equation is written as

   $$
a x^2 + b x + c = 0.
   $$

   This standard form makes it clear what the coefficients are.

2. **Identify the Coefficients:**

   Determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. These constants are essential for substituting into the formula.

3. **Substitute into the Formula:**

   Replace $a$, $b$, and $c$ in the quadratic formula:

   $$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
   $$

   This step transforms the general formula into a specific equation that you can solve.

4. **Calculate the Discriminant:**

   Evaluate

   $$
   D = b^2 - 4ac.
   $$

   The value of $D$ tells you whether the roots are real or complex, and whether they are distinct or repeated.

5. **Simplify:**

   Compute the square root and simplify the expression to solve for $x$. This involves basic arithmetic operations and simplifying the radical.

### Example 1: Solving $2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0$

1. **Standard Form:**

   The equation is already in standard form.

2. **Identify Coefficients:**

   $$
a = 2, \quad b = -4, \quad c = -6.
   $$

3. **Substitute into the Formula:**

   $$
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)}.
   $$

   Here, note that $-(-4)$ becomes $4$.

4. **Calculate the Discriminant:**

   $$
   (-4)^2 - 4(2)(-6) = 16 + 48 = 64.
   $$

   Since $64 > 0$, there are two real solutions.

5. **Simplify:**

   $$
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{64}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}.
   $$

   This gives two solutions:

   - For the plus case:

     $$
x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3.
     $$

   - For the minus case:

     $$
x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1.
     $$

   Thus, the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

### Example 2: Solving $x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0$

1. **Standard Form:**

   The equation is given as

   $$
x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0.
   $$

2. **Identify Coefficients:**

   $$
a = 1, \quad b = 6, \quad c = 8.
   $$

3. **Substitute into the Formula:**

   $$
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2(1)}.
   $$

4. **Calculate the Discriminant:**

   $$
   6^2 - 4(1)(8) = 36 - 32 = 4.
   $$

   A positive discriminant confirms two real roots.

5. **Simplify:**

   $$
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 2}{2}.
   $$

   This leads to two solutions:

   - For the plus case:

     $$
x = \frac{-6 + 2}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2.
     $$

   - For the minus case:

     $$
x = \frac{-6 - 2}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4.
     $$

   So, the solutions are $x = -2$ and $x = -4$.

Quadratic equations model many real-life situations. For instance, when analyzing the trajectory of a ball in sports, the height of the ball over time is often represented by a quadratic equation. In this model, the coefficients correspond to factors such as the initial speed of the ball and the acceleration due to gravity.

By applying the quadratic formula, you can determine when the ball reaches a specific height. This method not only demonstrates the power of algebra in predicting physical phenomena but also builds a strong foundation for solving engineering and physics problems.
