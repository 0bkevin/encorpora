## Key Notes for Writing Each Section

1. **Stay Focused on the Topic** – Each section is a detailed look at a single subject. Do not try to summarize other sections.
2. **Use Proper Header Levels** – Follow the filename conventions exactly to maintain the book’s structure.
3. **No Fluff** – Every word should add historical value. No unnecessary summaries or conclusions.
4. **Packed with Facts** – The more details and sources of interest, the better.
5. **No Oversimplification** – Young readers can handle real history, including complex topics. Explain where needed but don’t water things down.
6. **Context and Timelines Matter** – Always place events in their proper time and explain their impact.

This structure ensures that history is explored in full depth, with each section contributing to a **complete** and **cohesive** world history book.
